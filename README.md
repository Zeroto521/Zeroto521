# 👋 Hi there

I'm *40%*.

## :speech_balloon: About me

An informal developer. In Chinese, I'm called it as '野生的程序员'.

In fact, _development_ is not my main work. It's my hobby.

Actually, I'm a data scientist, especially in geographic data mining.

## :see_no_evil: Creed which I believe

- Do one thing and do the best. That also means 'Less is more'.
- Do the thing until to the end. That also means 'Never forget why you started'.
