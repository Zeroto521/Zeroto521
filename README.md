# 👋 Hi there

I'm *40%*.

## :speech_balloon: About me

An informal developer. In Chinese, I'm called '野生的程序员'.

In fact, _development_ is not my main work. It's my hobby.

Actually, I'm a data scientist with a focus on geographic data mining and operational optimization (including Network Planning, Vehicle Routing Planning, Vehicle Filling Planning, Asset Allocation Planning, and more).

## :see_no_evil: Creed which I believe

- Less is more.
- Never forget why you started.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Last 7 days, my coding stats
